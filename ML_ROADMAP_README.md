- **Flexible Pacing**: Adapt the schedule to your needs

## Key Milestones
1. **First ML Model**: Build your first classification project
2. **Deep Learning Project**: Create an image classification neural network
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy a model with proper monitoring

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to "ML Roadmap" in the navigation menu
2. Start with the Introduction phase (already expanded)
3. Click on topics to mark them as completed
4. Track your progress with the visual indicators
5. Use the motivation messages to stay encouraged

## Tips for Success
- **Consistency**: Study a little every day rather than cramming
- **Practice**: Build projects alongside theoretical learning
- **Community**: Join ML communities and forums for support
- **Patience**: ML is a complex field - progress takes time
